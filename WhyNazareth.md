#Founders and Coders in Nazareth
-----
##Why might you be hesitant about coming to FAC in Nazareth?

1. The logistics and arrangements of studying a coding bootcamp in a foreign country are unclear.
2. Broad concerns about being a foreigner in Nazareth/Israel.
3. Not sure if the course is intended for you, or someone like you.
4. Unsure if the course is different to the one in London.
