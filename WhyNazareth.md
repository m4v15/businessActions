#Founders and Coders in Nazareth
-----
##Why might you be hesitant about coming to FAC in Nazareth?

1. The logistics and arrangements of studying a coding bootcamp in a foreign country are unclear.
2. Broad concerns about being a foreigner in Nazareth/Israel.
3. Not sure if the course is intended for you, or someone like you.
4. Unsure if the course is different to the one in London.
5. Want to know why FAC have set up a course in Nazareth.

  Due to the nature of our application process, and how the course is run, we simply cannot provide you with some of the exact details of your stay you might want until much closer to the course start date.

  However, we can give a quick overview of a few logistics that you may be unaware of.

  We ask that people make their own travel arrangements to Nazareth before the course begins, but have some helpful suggestions:

    -Previous cohorts have all flown out from London on the same flight, which they arranged through our gitter channel beforehand. Making traveling to and through Israel much more comfortable and much less stressful.

    -We find arriving a few days before the course starts to be ideal to get to know your mentors, fellow students, and new home for the next 3 months (or more...)

    -(Insert part about whether to stay for 3 or more months)
